Hello there !
My Name is Elijah Stickel.

This is a speech_recognition code writen in python that utilizes the Google API(Aplicaton Program Interface) to turn your speech into text. This code will also be able to turn your text into speech. This uses speech_recognition and the pyAudio library for python to identifie audio. This code will hopefully teach you how to use the library as it can be difficult to try and learn how to do speech_recgonition. This is a list of the librarys you will need to install on pip.
